Naive_bayes_Gaus.py: the implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes 

In data folder there is pima-indians-diabetes.csv dataset comprising of 768 observations of women aged 21 and older. The dataset describes 
instantaneous measurements taken from patients, like age, blood workup, and the number of times they've been pregnant. Each record has a 
class value that indicates whether the patient suffered an onset of diabetes within 5 years. The values are 1 for Diabetic and 0 for 
Non-Diabetic.

To understand how Gaussian Naive Bayes works I am going to code it from scratch. I've broken the whole process down into the following steps: 1) handle data; 2) summarize data; 3) make predictions; 4) evaluate accuracy; 5) compare my implementation with sklearn one.
